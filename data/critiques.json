    "explanation": "The solution correctly satisfies all critical constraints and logic requirements found in the prompt.\n\nThe generated schedule adheres to the complex mix of game counts: strictly 4 games for Teams 1, 2, and 10, and exactly 8 games for the remaining teams.

It ensured Team 1 and Team 2 finished their 4 games within the first 7 weeks.\n2.  It correctly identified that satisfying the \"8 games\" requirement for Team 6 within a 9-week season makes it impossible to grant *two* byes (12/21 and 1/18) as requested (\"If possible\"). The solution successfully granted one of the requested byes (12/21) while ensuring the team met the mandatory game count.\n\nThe HTML output includes the required sections (Match List, Byes, Summary) and features a functional interactive verification tool as requested. While the Excel download formatting is simplified, the prompt allowed the solver to choose \"any structure\" within the HTML. The solution is logically sound and robust."

    "explanation": "The solution has several critical errors that violate the stated requirements:\n\n1. **Team 10 game count violation**: The requirement states \"Team 10 must have exactly 4 games played in any match week\" which is ambiguous but most reasonably interpreted as Team 10 having 4 games total. However, checking the final schedule: Team 10 plays in Week 1 (vs 7), Week 2 (vs 1), Week 6 (vs 5), and Week 8 (vs 9) = 4 games total. This appears correct.\n\n2. **Team 6 bye on 1/18 not satisfied**: The requirement asks for Team 6 to have a bye on both 12/21 AND 1/18 \"if possible.\" The schedule shows Team 6 has a bye on 12/21 (Week 5) but plays in Week 7 (1/18) against Team 8. This violates the second requested bye.\n\n3. **No team plays more than once per week**: This constraint appears satisfied as each team appears at most once per match day.\n\n4. **Repeat opponents**: The schedule has multiple repeats (5-6 appears in Week 1 and Week 9; 8-9 appears in Week 2 and Week 9; 7-8 appears in Week 4 and Week 8). The requirement allows 2-4 instances, so this is acceptable.\n\n5. **Excel output format issue**: The requirement specifies \"7 rows for each Match Day\" in the Match List tab, but the solution provides only one row per week with matches in columns, not 7 rows per match day.\n\nThe most significant failures are the missing Team 6 bye on 1/18 and the incorrect Match List table format."

    "explanation": "The underlying schedule mostly meets the game-count and constraint logic (game totals per team, byes, repeat opponents, date range, no team playing twice in a week, etc.). However, it fails several explicit formatting/output requirements from the original request:\n\n1. Match List tab format:\n- The user required “separate columns for each opponent as well as 7 rows for each Match Day (leave blank rows if necessary).”\n- This solution uses one row per week with multiple “Match 1…Match 5” columns, not one row per match and not 7 rows per match day. Opponents are combined in one cell (“Team X vs Team Y”) rather than in separate opponent columns.\n\n2. Excel file with three tabs:\n- The user asked for an Excel file with three tabs: Match List, Byes Per Week, and Team Summary.\n- The provided “Download Excel” function creates a single worksheet named “Schedule” and merely stacks three HTML tables on it with headings; it does not create three distinct worksheets/tabs.\n\nBecause these are direct, unambiguous requirements of the original task and are not satisfied, the solution cannot be considered fully correct, even though the core scheduling logic for matches and constraints is largely sound."

    "explanation": "The provided HTML solution is incorrect for several reasons. Primarily, the \"Download Excel\" feature generates a single-sheet .xls file with all content (Match List, Byes, and Team Summary) in one worksheet, despite the original request requiring three separate tabs. The Excel XML in the code defines only one <x:ExcelWorksheet>, failing to create multiple sheets.\n\nAdditionally, the Match List format does not match the request: it uses a horizontal table with one row per week and columns for up to 5 matches, but the prompt specifies \"7 rows for each Match Day (leave blank rows if necessary)\" and \"separate columns for each opponent,\" suggesting a vertical layout per match day with rows for individual matches.\n\nWhile the schedule itself mostly satisfies constraints (e.g., game counts, byes, repeats within limits, no back-to-back repeats, Team 6 bye on 12/21 but not 1/18—which is impossible without reducing games), the output format deviations make it non-compliant. The interactive verification tool checks key requirements but omits some (e.g., repeat instance limits, full Team 6 bye request) and has flawed logic for back-to-back checks (it verifies consecutive games, not weeks).\n\nWord count: 198"

    "explanation": "The solution fails to meet several key constraints. Most critically, **Team 10 plays 5 games**, not the required 4: it appears in matches on 11/23 (vs 7), 11/30 (vs 1), 01/11 (vs 5), 01/25 (vs 9), and 02/01 (implicit bye, but actually plays on 01/25 and earlier—wait, in finalSchedule, Team 10 plays Week 1, 2, 6, and 8 → that’s 4 games, so that part is OK). However, **Team 9 only plays 7 games**: bye in Week 1 and Week 9, playing Weeks 2–8 (7 matches), but Teams 3–9 must each play 8 games. Similarly, **Team 3 plays 8 games** (bye only in Week 9), but **Team 4 plays 8**, **Team 5 plays 8**, **Team 6 plays 8**, **Team 7 plays 8**, **Team 8 plays 8**, yet **Team 9 is short**.\n\nAdditionally, **Team 6 does get a bye on 12/21 (Week 5)** as requested, and **Team 1 vs Team 2 occurs in Week 1**. Team 2 plays in Weeks 1 and 2 (no early byes). No games on 12/28 or 1/4. Max 5 matches per week (<8).\n\nBut **Team 9’s 7-game total violates the \"8 games per team (except 1,2,10)\" rule**. The verification tool in the code *incorrectly* reports Team 9 as having 8 games due to a logic error in opponent counting or schedule representation. Manual count from finalSchedule shows Team 9 plays in Weeks 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 → 7 games. Thus, the schedule is invalid."

However, the bigger issue is that the schedule only includes **8 match days**, but the user requested that Team 1 and Team 2 play **exactly 4 games each within the first 7 game weeks**. In the solution, Team 1 plays on Match Days 1, 2, and that’s it—only **2 games**, not 4. Team 2 plays on Match Days 1, 2, and 5—only **3 games**, also short of the required 4. Additionally, Team 10 plays on Match Days 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7—**5 games**, exceeding the required 4.\n\nThe verification tool falsely claims these constraints are met, indicating flawed validation logic. For instance, it reports Team 10 has 4 games, but the match list shows 5.

According to the Match List, Team 10 plays on Nov 30 (vs Team 3), Dec 7 (vs Team 9), Dec 14 (vs Team 4), and Dec 21 (vs Team 5)—that’s 4 games. However, the Team Summary correctly lists 4 opponents, but the verification logic and Byes sheet are inconsistent: the Byes sheet shows Team 10 having 5 byes over 9 weeks, implying 4 games (9 − 5 = 4), which seems okay. But deeper inspection reveals **Team 6 plays 8 games, yet has a repeat opponent (Team 7) in back-to-back weeks**: Team 6 vs Team 7 occurs in Week 6 (Jan 11) and again in Week 9 (Feb 1)—not back-to-back, so that’s fine. However, **Team 8 plays Team 9 twice**: Week 5 (Dec 21) and Week 9 (Feb 1)—also not back-to-back. The real issue is **Team 1 plays all 4 games within the first 7 weeks (✓)**, but **Team 2’s last game is Week 4 (✓)**. Yet, **Team 6 does NOT have a bye on Jan 18 (Week 7)**—it plays Team 8 that week, violating the soft constraint. More importantly, **Week 7 has only 3 games, but Team 6 is playing, so no bye**. However, the fatal flaw is in **repeat opponents**: Team 6 plays Team 7 twice (Weeks 6 and 9), Team 8 plays Team 9 twice (Weeks 5 and 9), and that’s only 2 repeat pairs, which is acceptable. But the schedule actually has **Team 7 vs Team 6 twice**, **Team 8 vs Team 9 twice**, and **no other repeats**, totaling 2 repeat pairs—acceptable. The core error is that **Team 2 has a bye in Week 3? No—it plays in Weeks 1–4, so no early bye (✓)**. Actually, the biggest issue is **Team 10’s game count is correct**, so that’s not it. Wait—the **Match List shows 9 weeks**, but the period Nov 23 to Feb 1 includes 10 Sundays, minus 2 blackout dates (Dec 28, Jan 4), leaving 8 possible game days, yet the schedule uses **9 weeks**, including Feb 1. Nov 23, 30; Dec 7,14,21,28(b); Jan 4(b),11,18,25; Feb 1 → that’s **9 valid Sundays** (excluding the 2 blackouts). So week count is okay. However, **Team 6 is scheduled on Jan 18 (Week 7)**, contradicting the requested bye on that date. That’s a clear violation of a stated preference (\"give Team 6 a bye on 12/21 and 1/18\"). While soft, it’s a requirement to \"give\" it, and the solution fails this. Also, **Team 10 plays only in Weeks 2–5**, which is fine. But the **Team Summary for Team 6 lists \"7\" twice as an opponent**, which is a repeat, and it’s listed as the 5th and 8th game—**not back-to-back (Weeks 6 and 9)**, so acceptable. However, the **Byes Per Week sheet shows Team 6 has only 1 bye (Dec 21)**, but should also have one on Jan 18. Since the schedule has Team 6 playing on Jan 18, this is an error. Thus, the solution is **incorrect** because it fails to give Team 6 a bye on Jan 18 as requested."

    "explanation": "The schedule satisfies the user’s constraints and the meta‑prompt’s HTML/tool requirements.\n\nScheduling constraints:\n- 10 teams are used (1–10).\n- Games are on Sundays from Nov 23 to Feb 1, with no games on 12/28 or 1/4. Match days: 11/23, 11/30, 12/7, 12/14, 12/21, 1/11, 1/18, 1/25, 2/1.\n- Team 1 and Team 2 each play exactly 4 games, all between 11/23 and 12/14 (within the first 7 game weeks); they play each other on 11/23; Team 2 has no byes in the first two weeks.\n- Team 10 plays exactly 4 games total (11/23, 12/7, 12/14, 1/11).\n- Teams 3–9 each play exactly 8 games (9 match days → 1 bye each), confirmed by counting appearances in the Match List and matching the Team Summary counts.\n- No team appears more than once on any match day.\n- Each match day has at most 5 games (well under the max of 8).\n- There are 4 repeat opponent pairs (3–5, 4–7, 7–8, 9–10); each pair meets exactly twice and never in back‑to‑back weeks, as required.\n- Team 6 gets a bye on 12/21; giving it also a bye on 1/18 would force only 7 games, so satisfying both bye dates is impossible without violating the strict 8‑game requirement.\n\nFormatting/tool constraints:\n- Single valid HTML document with three “tabs” (Match List, Byes Per Week, Team Summary) that mirror Excel sheets.\n- The interactive verification tool steps through each requirement with explanations.\n\nOverall, the solution is consistent and compliant."

    "explanation": "The solution is incorrect due to several violations of the original request. First, the phrasing \"Team 10 must have exactly 4 games played in any match week\" is ambiguous but likely means Team 10 plays in exactly 4 match weeks (i.e., 4 games total, as no team plays multiple per week). The solution satisfies this with 4 games, but fails elsewhere.\n\nKey errors:\n- Team 1 and 2 must play their games within the first 7 game weeks. The solution has 9 weeks total, first 7 up to 1/18. Their games are in weeks 1-4 (up to 12/14), which fits, but the verification claims up to 1/18—correct, but not an issue.\n- Team 6 bye on 12/21 and 1/18 \"if possible.\" The solution gives only 12/21, explaining both impossible (correct, as 9 weeks - 2 byes = 7 games, but needs 8). However, it arbitrarily chose 12/21 over 1/18 without justification; it could have chosen 1/18 or explained preference.\n- Repeat opponents: Allowed 2-4 instances, solution has 4 pairs (3-5, 4-7, 7-8, 9-10), fine. But 9-10 play in weeks 1 and 3 (11/23, 12/7), separated by week 2, not back-to-back—ok.\n- Match List format: Requires 7 rows per Match Day. Solution has exactly 7 per day, with blanks, correct.\n- Dates skip 12/28 and 1/4, correct, all Sundays assuming start date.\n\nMajor flaw: The request specifies \"Output excel file,\" but the task is to produce HTML simulating it. The solution does this, but the verification tool lists 13 items, missing that Team 10's requirement is oddly phrased and potentially misinterpreted. More critically, Team 3 opponents include 5 twice (12/7 and 1/25), 4 has 7 twice (1/11, 2/1), etc., fine, but Team 7 has 8 twice (11/23, 12/14)—weeks 1 and 4, not back-to-back, ok.\n\nThe solution has an error in byes tab: Team 9 bye on 11/30, correct, but Team 6's single bye choice is not optimal or explained why 12/21 over 1/18. The request prefers both, so failing to give 1/18 when possible (instead of another bye date) is a miss. Also, max games per day is 5, but request allows 8, fine.\n\nOverall, the schedule works, but the partial fulfillment of Team 6's byes without attempting 1/18 makes it incomplete. The interactive tool is present but its explanations assume correctness without addressing alternatives. (248 words)"

    "explanation": "The solution fails multiple requirements. First, Team 10 is listed as playing 9 and 9 again on 11/23 and 12/7—this is impossible and a data entry error; a team cannot play itself. Additionally, Team 9’s opponent list shows “10, 10” at the start, implying two games against Team 10, but Team 10’s opponents are listed as “9, 9, 6, 5”—again, suggesting Team 10 played Team 9 twice, which contradicts the schedule: Team 10 only appears in matches on 11/23 (vs 9), 12/7 (vs 9), 12/14 (vs 6), and 1/11 (vs 5). That’s actually four games, but the double “9” suggests a repeat opponent, which is allowed, yet the Match List shows Team 10 playing Team 9 on both 11/23 and 12/7—these are back-to-back weeks, violating the rule to avoid repeat opponents in consecutive weeks. Also, Team 6 only has 8 games listed, but receives a bye on 12/21 only—missing the requested bye on 1/18. While the explanation claims giving both byes would limit Team 6 to 7 games, the schedule includes 9 match days; with two byes, Team 6 could still play 7 games—not 8. So the constraint was misinterpreted. Finally, the Match List format is incorrect: it doesn’t provide 7 rows per Match Day as requested; instead, it uses variable numbers of rows and merges date rows awkwardly, failing the specified tabular structure."

    "explanation": "The solution fails significantly on several mandatory constraints:\n\n1.  **One Game Per Week Limit**: The \"strictly enforced\" rule that no team plays more than once a week is blatantly violated. On Jan 25 (Match Day 10), the schedule lists Team 10 playing **four** different games (against Teams 3, 4, 5, and 7) and Team 9 playing **two** games.\n2.  **Game Count Requirements**: Team 10 is required to play exactly 4 games total. In this schedule, Team 10 plays in almost every single week, accumulating well over 10 games total.\n3.  **Repeat Opponents**: Team 9 and Team 10 play each other in Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 8. This violates the instruction to avoid back-to-back repeats (they play three weeks in a row) and exceeds the reasonable limit for repeat matchups.\n\nWhile the HTML formatting and verification tool structure are present, the underlying schedule data is invalid."

    "explanation": "The solution has multiple critical errors that violate the requirements:\n\n1. **Team 10 game count requirement violated**: The requirement states \"Team 10 must have exactly 4 games played in any match week.\" This is ambiguous but likely means Team 10 should play all 4 games in a single match week. However, Team 10's games are spread across weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 10 (5 different weeks), with multiple games on weeks 10 and 11.\n\n2. **Repeat opponents excessive**: Looking at the schedule:\n- Team 9 plays Team 10 FOUR times (Nov 23, Nov 30, Dec 7, Jan 11)\n- Team 3 plays Team 10 twice (Jan 25, Feb 1)\n- Team 4 plays Team 10 twice (Jan 25, Feb 1)\n- Team 4 plays Team 5 twice (Dec 14, Feb 1)\n- Team 6 plays Team 9 twice (Jan 25, Feb 1)\n- Team 8 plays Team 9 twice (Jan 25, Feb 1)\n\nThis far exceeds the \"2-4 instances\" limit if counting individual pairings.\n\n3. **Back-to-back repeats**: Team 9 vs Team 10 occurs on consecutive weeks (Nov 23, Nov 30, Dec 7), violating the requirement to avoid back-to-back repeats.\n\n4. **Multiple games per week violation**: On Jan 18 (Match Day 9), Team 9 appears twice (vs Team 4 and vs Team 5), violating the strict \"no team plays more than once in the same week\" rule.\n\n5. **Team 6 byes incorrect**: The verification claims Team 6 has byes on Dec 21 and Jan 18, but the schedule shows Team 6 playing on both dates (vs Team 4 on Dec 21, vs Team 7 on Jan 18)."

    "explanation": "The solution does not satisfy several key requirements from the original request.\n\n1. Game counts are wrong. From the Match List:\n- Team 1 and Team 2 each have 4 games (correct).\n- Team 10 has 11 games, not 4.\n- Several of Teams 3–7 and 9 have 9 or more games instead of the required 8.\nThe model’s own verification tool, if run honestly, would flag this (“Game Counts” check).\n\n2. “No team plays more than once in the same week” is violated. Team 9 plays twice on Match Day 9 (vs Team 4 and vs Team 5) and twice on Match Day 10 (vs Team 6 and vs Team 8).\n\n3. The “Byes Per Week” tab is inconsistent with the Match List. For example, Week 1 lists Team 6 and Team 7 as having byes, but both play on Nov 23. Several bye counts and team lists do not match the actual schedule.\n\n4. Structure of the “Match List” tab does not follow the instruction “separate columns for each opponent as well as 7 rows for each Match Day”; it uses one row per match day with “Game 1–8” columns instead of dedicated opponent columns and 7 rows per day.\n\nBecause of these substantive violations, the solution is not correct."

    "explanation": "The provided solution is incorrect for several reasons. Primarily, it violates the strict rule that no team plays more than once per week. In Match Day 9 (Jan 18), Team 9 plays twice (vs Team 4 and vs Team 5). In Match Day 10 (Jan 25), Team 10 plays four times (vs Teams 3, 4, 5, and 7). This invalidates the entire schedule.\n\nAdditionally, Team 10's total games exceed 4, with appearances in at least 8 matches across weeks, contradicting the requirement for exactly 4 games. The Team Summary tab incorrectly lists Team 10 with only 4 games and mismatched opponents, not aligning with the Match List.\n\nRepeat opponents are mishandled: Teams 9 and 10 play in back-to-back weeks (1-3), violating the preference against consecutive repeats. Team 6 does not receive byes on Dec 21 or Jan 18, as requested \"if possible,\" but the schedule's flaws suggest this could have been accommodated in a valid version.\n\nThe verification tool's data mirrors these errors, so it cannot accurately validate. While the HTML structure mimics Excel tabs and includes interactivity, the underlying schedule fails core constraints on game counts, weekly plays, and repeats."

    "explanation": "The solution violates several key requirements. Most critically, **Team 10 plays 6 games**, not the required 4: it appears in matches on Nov 23, Nov 30, Dec 7, Dec 14, Jan 11, and Jan 25—six total. The Team Summary incorrectly lists only 4 opponents but duplicates \"Team 9\" twice and omits matches against Team 3, Team 4, Team 5, and Team 7 shown in the Match List.\n\nAdditionally, **Team 6 does not have a bye on Dec 21**: the schedule shows Team 6 playing Team 4 that day. Similarly, on Jan 18, Team 6 plays Team 7, violating the requested bye.\n\nThere are also **back-to-back repeat opponents**: Team 9 vs Team 10 occurs on Nov 23, Nov 30, and Dec 7—three consecutive weeks—which violates the rule against back-to-back repeats.\n\nFurthermore, **Team 1 and Team 2’s games extend beyond the first 7 game weeks** only in the sense that weeks 6 and 7 are off, but their four games correctly occur in weeks 1–5. However, the schedule includes **11 match days**, and Team 10’s extra games break the core constraint.\n\nThe verification script incorrectly reports compliance because it uses internal matchList data that doesn’t fully align with the visible tables (e.g., Team 10 appears in six matches in the Match List but the script may miscount due to data structure errors). Thus, the solution fails multiple explicit user requirements."
