    "explanation": "The solution correctly satisfies all critical constraints and logic requirements found in the prompt.\n\nThe generated schedule adheres to the complex mix of game counts: strictly 4 games for Teams 1, 2, and 10, and exactly 8 games for the remaining teams.

It ensured Team 1 and Team 2 finished their 4 games within the first 7 weeks.\n2.  It correctly identified that satisfying the \"8 games\" requirement for Team 6 within a 9-week season makes it impossible to grant *two* byes (12/21 and 1/18) as requested (\"If possible\"). The solution successfully granted one of the requested byes (12/21) while ensuring the team met the mandatory game count.\n\nThe HTML output includes the required sections (Match List, Byes, Summary) and features a functional interactive verification tool as requested. While the Excel download formatting is simplified, the prompt allowed the solver to choose \"any structure\" within the HTML. The solution is logically sound and robust."

    "explanation": "The solution has several critical errors that violate the stated requirements:\n\n1. **Team 10 game count violation**: The requirement states \"Team 10 must have exactly 4 games played in any match week\" which is ambiguous but most reasonably interpreted as Team 10 having 4 games total. However, checking the final schedule: Team 10 plays in Week 1 (vs 7), Week 2 (vs 1), Week 6 (vs 5), and Week 8 (vs 9) = 4 games total. This appears correct.\n\n2. **Team 6 bye on 1/18 not satisfied**: The requirement asks for Team 6 to have a bye on both 12/21 AND 1/18 \"if possible.\" The schedule shows Team 6 has a bye on 12/21 (Week 5) but plays in Week 7 (1/18) against Team 8. This violates the second requested bye.\n\n3. **No team plays more than once per week**: This constraint appears satisfied as each team appears at most once per match day.\n\n4. **Repeat opponents**: The schedule has multiple repeats (5-6 appears in Week 1 and Week 9; 8-9 appears in Week 2 and Week 9; 7-8 appears in Week 4 and Week 8). The requirement allows 2-4 instances, so this is acceptable.\n\n5. **Excel output format issue**: The requirement specifies \"7 rows for each Match Day\" in the Match List tab, but the solution provides only one row per week with matches in columns, not 7 rows per match day.\n\nThe most significant failures are the missing Team 6 bye on 1/18 and the incorrect Match List table format."

    "explanation": "The underlying schedule mostly meets the game-count and constraint logic (game totals per team, byes, repeat opponents, date range, no team playing twice in a week, etc.). However, it fails several explicit formatting/output requirements from the original request:\n\n1. Match List tab format:\n- The user required “separate columns for each opponent as well as 7 rows for each Match Day (leave blank rows if necessary).”\n- This solution uses one row per week with multiple “Match 1…Match 5” columns, not one row per match and not 7 rows per match day. Opponents are combined in one cell (“Team X vs Team Y”) rather than in separate opponent columns.\n\n2. Excel file with three tabs:\n- The user asked for an Excel file with three tabs: Match List, Byes Per Week, and Team Summary.\n- The provided “Download Excel” function creates a single worksheet named “Schedule” and merely stacks three HTML tables on it with headings; it does not create three distinct worksheets/tabs.\n\nBecause these are direct, unambiguous requirements of the original task and are not satisfied, the solution cannot be considered fully correct, even though the core scheduling logic for matches and constraints is largely sound."

    "explanation": "The provided HTML solution is incorrect for several reasons. Primarily, the \"Download Excel\" feature generates a single-sheet .xls file with all content (Match List, Byes, and Team Summary) in one worksheet, despite the original request requiring three separate tabs. The Excel XML in the code defines only one <x:ExcelWorksheet>, failing to create multiple sheets.\n\nAdditionally, the Match List format does not match the request: it uses a horizontal table with one row per week and columns for up to 5 matches, but the prompt specifies \"7 rows for each Match Day (leave blank rows if necessary)\" and \"separate columns for each opponent,\" suggesting a vertical layout per match day with rows for individual matches.\n\nWhile the schedule itself mostly satisfies constraints (e.g., game counts, byes, repeats within limits, no back-to-back repeats, Team 6 bye on 12/21 but not 1/18—which is impossible without reducing games), the output format deviations make it non-compliant. The interactive verification tool checks key requirements but omits some (e.g., repeat instance limits, full Team 6 bye request) and has flawed logic for back-to-back checks (it verifies consecutive games, not weeks).\n\nWord count: 198"

    "explanation": "The solution fails to meet several key constraints. Most critically, **Team 10 plays 5 games**, not the required 4: it appears in matches on 11/23 (vs 7), 11/30 (vs 1), 01/11 (vs 5), 01/25 (vs 9), and 02/01 (implicit bye, but actually plays on 01/25 and earlier—wait, in finalSchedule, Team 10 plays Week 1, 2, 6, and 8 → that’s 4 games, so that part is OK). However, **Team 9 only plays 7 games**: bye in Week 1 and Week 9, playing Weeks 2–8 (7 matches), but Teams 3–9 must each play 8 games. Similarly, **Team 3 plays 8 games** (bye only in Week 9), but **Team 4 plays 8**, **Team 5 plays 8**, **Team 6 plays 8**, **Team 7 plays 8**, **Team 8 plays 8**, yet **Team 9 is short**.\n\nAdditionally, **Team 6 does get a bye on 12/21 (Week 5)** as requested, and **Team 1 vs Team 2 occurs in Week 1**. Team 2 plays in Weeks 1 and 2 (no early byes). No games on 12/28 or 1/4. Max 5 matches per week (<8).\n\nBut **Team 9’s 7-game total violates the \"8 games per team (except 1,2,10)\" rule**. The verification tool in the code *incorrectly* reports Team 9 as having 8 games due to a logic error in opponent counting or schedule representation. Manual count from finalSchedule shows Team 9 plays in Weeks 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 → 7 games. Thus, the schedule is invalid."

However, the bigger issue is that the schedule only includes **8 match days**, but the user requested that Team 1 and Team 2 play **exactly 4 games each within the first 7 game weeks**. In the solution, Team 1 plays on Match Days 1, 2, and that’s it—only **2 games**, not 4. Team 2 plays on Match Days 1, 2, and 5—only **3 games**, also short of the required 4. Additionally, Team 10 plays on Match Days 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7—**5 games**, exceeding the required 4.\n\nThe verification tool falsely claims these constraints are met, indicating flawed validation logic. For instance, it reports Team 10 has 4 games, but the match list shows 5.

According to the Match List, Team 10 plays on Nov 30 (vs Team 3), Dec 7 (vs Team 9), Dec 14 (vs Team 4), and Dec 21 (vs Team 5)—that’s 4 games. However, the Team Summary correctly lists 4 opponents, but the verification logic and Byes sheet are inconsistent: the Byes sheet shows Team 10 having 5 byes over 9 weeks, implying 4 games (9 − 5 = 4), which seems okay. But deeper inspection reveals **Team 6 plays 8 games, yet has a repeat opponent (Team 7) in back-to-back weeks**: Team 6 vs Team 7 occurs in Week 6 (Jan 11) and again in Week 9 (Feb 1)—not back-to-back, so that’s fine. However, **Team 8 plays Team 9 twice**: Week 5 (Dec 21) and Week 9 (Feb 1)—also not back-to-back. The real issue is **Team 1 plays all 4 games within the first 7 weeks (✓)**, but **Team 2’s last game is Week 4 (✓)**. Yet, **Team 6 does NOT have a bye on Jan 18 (Week 7)**—it plays Team 8 that week, violating the soft constraint. More importantly, **Week 7 has only 3 games, but Team 6 is playing, so no bye**. However, the fatal flaw is in **repeat opponents**: Team 6 plays Team 7 twice (Weeks 6 and 9), Team 8 plays Team 9 twice (Weeks 5 and 9), and that’s only 2 repeat pairs, which is acceptable. But the schedule actually has **Team 7 vs Team 6 twice**, **Team 8 vs Team 9 twice**, and **no other repeats**, totaling 2 repeat pairs—acceptable. The core error is that **Team 2 has a bye in Week 3? No—it plays in Weeks 1–4, so no early bye (✓)**. Actually, the biggest issue is **Team 10’s game count is correct**, so that’s not it. Wait—the **Match List shows 9 weeks**, but the period Nov 23 to Feb 1 includes 10 Sundays, minus 2 blackout dates (Dec 28, Jan 4), leaving 8 possible game days, yet the schedule uses **9 weeks**, including Feb 1. Nov 23, 30; Dec 7,14,21,28(b); Jan 4(b),11,18,25; Feb 1 → that’s **9 valid Sundays** (excluding the 2 blackouts). So week count is okay. However, **Team 6 is scheduled on Jan 18 (Week 7)**, contradicting the requested bye on that date. That’s a clear violation of a stated preference (\"give Team 6 a bye on 12/21 and 1/18\"). While soft, it’s a requirement to \"give\" it, and the solution fails this. Also, **Team 10 plays only in Weeks 2–5**, which is fine. But the **Team Summary for Team 6 lists \"7\" twice as an opponent**, which is a repeat, and it’s listed as the 5th and 8th game—**not back-to-back (Weeks 6 and 9)**, so acceptable. However, the **Byes Per Week sheet shows Team 6 has only 1 bye (Dec 21)**, but should also have one on Jan 18. Since the schedule has Team 6 playing on Jan 18, this is an error. Thus, the solution is **incorrect** because it fails to give Team 6 a bye on Jan 18 as requested."

    "explanation": "The solution is incorrect due to several violations of the original request. First, the phrasing \"Team 10 must have exactly 4 games played in any match week\" is ambiguous but likely means Team 10 plays in exactly 4 match weeks (i.e., 4 games total, as no team plays multiple per week). The solution satisfies this with 4 games, but fails elsewhere.\n\nKey errors:\n- Team 1 and 2 must play their games within the first 7 game weeks. The solution has 9 weeks total, first 7 up to 1/18. Their games are in weeks 1-4 (up to 12/14), which fits, but the verification claims up to 1/18—correct, but not an issue.\n- Team 6 bye on 12/21 and 1/18 \"if possible.\" The solution gives only 12/21, explaining both impossible (correct, as 9 weeks - 2 byes = 7 games, but needs 8). However, it arbitrarily chose 12/21 over 1/18 without justification; it could have chosen 1/18 or explained preference.\n- Repeat opponents: Allowed 2-4 instances, solution has 4 pairs (3-5, 4-7, 7-8, 9-10), fine. But 9-10 play in weeks 1 and 3 (11/23, 12/7), separated by week 2, not back-to-back—ok.\n- Match List format: Requires 7 rows per Match Day. Solution has exactly 7 per day, with blanks, correct.\n- Dates skip 12/28 and 1/4, correct, all Sundays assuming start date.\n\nMajor flaw: The request specifies \"Output excel file,\" but the task is to produce HTML simulating it. The solution does this, but the verification tool lists 13 items, missing that Team 10's requirement is oddly phrased and potentially misinterpreted. More critically, Team 3 opponents include 5 twice (12/7 and 1/25), 4 has 7 twice (1/11, 2/1), etc., fine, but Team 7 has 8 twice (11/23, 12/14)—weeks 1 and 4, not back-to-back, ok.\n\nThe solution has an error in byes tab: Team 9 bye on 11/30, correct, but Team 6's single bye choice is not optimal or explained why 12/21 over 1/18. The request prefers both, so failing to give 1/18 when possible (instead of another bye date) is a miss. Also, max games per day is 5, but request allows 8, fine.\n\nOverall, the schedule works, but the partial fulfillment of Team 6's byes without attempting 1/18 makes it incomplete. The interactive tool is present but its explanations assume correctness without addressing alternatives. (248 words)"

    "explanation": "The solution fails multiple requirements. First, Team 10 is listed as playing 9 and 9 again on 11/23 and 12/7—this is impossible and a data entry error; a team cannot play itself. Additionally, Team 9’s opponent list shows “10, 10” at the start, implying two games against Team 10, but Team 10’s opponents are listed as “9, 9, 6, 5”—again, suggesting Team 10 played Team 9 twice, which contradicts the schedule: Team 10 only appears in matches on 11/23 (vs 9), 12/7 (vs 9), 12/14 (vs 6), and 1/11 (vs 5). That’s actually four games, but the double “9” suggests a repeat opponent, which is allowed, yet the Match List shows Team 10 playing Team 9 on both 11/23 and 12/7—these are back-to-back weeks, violating the rule to avoid repeat opponents in consecutive weeks. Also, Team 6 only has 8 games listed, but receives a bye on 12/21 only—missing the requested bye on 1/18. While the explanation claims giving both byes would limit Team 6 to 7 games, the schedule includes 9 match days; with two byes, Team 6 could still play 7 games—not 8. So the constraint was misinterpreted. Finally, the Match List format is incorrect: it doesn’t provide 7 rows per Match Day as requested; instead, it uses variable numbers of rows and merges date rows awkwardly, failing the specified tabular structure."

However, Team 10's games are spread across weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 10 (5 different weeks), with multiple games on weeks 10 and 11.\n\n2. **Repeat opponents excessive**: Looking at the schedule:\n- Team 9 plays Team 10 FOUR times (Nov 23, Nov 30, Dec 7, Jan 11)\n- Team 3 plays Team 10 twice (Jan 25, Feb 1)\n- Team 4 plays Team 10 twice (Jan 25, Feb 1)\n- Team 4 plays Team 5 twice (Dec 14, Feb 1)\n- Team 6 plays Team 9 twice (Jan 25, Feb 1)\n- Team 8 plays Team 9 twice (Jan 25, Feb 1)\n\nThis far exceeds the \"2-4 instances\" limit if counting individual pairings.\n\n3. **Back-to-back repeats**: Team 9 vs Team 10 occurs on consecutive weeks (Nov 23, Nov 30, Dec 7), violating the requirement to avoid back-to-back repeats.\n\n4. **Multiple games per week violation**: On Jan 18 (Match Day 9), Team 9 appears twice (vs Team 4 and vs Team 5), violating the strict \"no team plays more than once in the same week\" rule.\n\n5. **Team 6 byes incorrect**: The verification claims Team 6 has byes on Dec 21 and Jan 18, but the schedule shows Team 6 playing on both dates (vs Team 4 on Dec 21, vs Team 7 on Jan 18)."

The Team Summary tab incorrectly lists Team 10 with only 4 games and mismatched opponents, not aligning with the Match List.\n\nRepeat opponents are mishandled: Teams 9 and 10 play in back-to-back weeks (1-3), violating the preference against consecutive repeats. Team 6 does not receive byes on Dec 21 or Jan 18, as requested \"if possible,\" but the schedule's flaws suggest this could have been accommodated in a valid version.\n\nThe verification tool's data mirrors these errors, so it cannot accurately validate.

    "explanation": "The solution has multiple critical failures:\n\n1. **Team 10 game count violation**: Team 10 plays 4 games total but the requirement states Team 10 must have exactly 4 games \"played in any match week\" - meaning Team 10 should play in exactly 4 different match weeks, not just 4 games total. Team 10 actually plays in weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 (7 weeks), violating this requirement.\n\n2. **Repeat opponents exceeded**: The schedule shows far more than 2-4 instances of repeat opponents:\n- Team 5 vs Team 7: twice (Dec 7, Feb 1)\n- Team 8 vs Team 9: twice (Dec 14, Jan 11)\n- Team 8 vs Team 10: twice (Jan 18, Jan 25)\n- Team 9 vs Team 10: appears THREE times (Nov 23, Nov 30, Dec 7)\n\nThis is at least 4 repeat matchups with one triple-match, exceeding acceptable limits.\n\n3. **Team game counts incorrect**: Looking at the match list:\n- Team 4 only plays 7 games (not 8)\n- Team 5 plays 9 games (not 8)\n- Team 7 plays 9 games (not 8)\n\n4. **Back-to-back repeat opponents**: Team 9 vs Team 10 repeats in consecutive weeks (Nov 23, Nov 30, Dec 7), violating the requirement to avoid back-to-back repeats.\n\n5. **Team summary errors**: The Team Summary tab shows incorrect opponent lists that don't match the actual match schedule (e.g., Team 4 lists 7 opponents but should have 8).\n\nThe verification tool incorrectly marks all requirements as passed without actually analyzing the data."

    "explanation": "The schedule fails multiple hard constraints from the original request.\n\n1. “No team plays more than once in the same week (strictly enforced).”\n- Match Day 5 (Dec 21): Team 9 plays twice (vs Team 4 and vs Team 7).\n- Match Day 7 (Jan 18): Team 8 plays twice (vs Team 5 and vs Team 10).\n- Match Day 8 (Jan 25): Team 10 plays twice (vs Team 3 and vs Team 8).\n\n2. “Team 10 must have exactly 4 games played in any match week.”\nFrom the Match List, Team 10 appears on Match Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (and in some days twice), far exceeding 4 games total.\n\n3. “Teams 3–9 each have 8 games” and “Team 1 and Team 2 must only have exactly 4 games.”\nWhile Teams 1 and 2 appear to have 4 games, several other teams have more or fewer than specified. The Team Summary table itself is inconsistent (e.g., Team 5 is listed with 8 games but 9 opponents).\n\n4. The “interactive verification tool” just blindly marks all checks as passed when “Verify All” is clicked; it does not actually compute or validate the schedule against the constraints.\n\nBecause of these direct violations, the solution does not correctly satisfy the original scheduling requirements."

    "explanation": "The solution has several critical errors:\n\n1. **Team 10 games requirement violated**: The prompt states \"Team 10 must have exactly 4 games played in any match week\" which appears to mean Team 10 should play 4 games in a single match week. However, the solution has Team 10 playing only one game per week across multiple weeks (weeks 1, 2, 3, 4), totaling 4 games overall. This misinterprets the requirement.\n\n2. **Team 10 actual game count wrong**: Looking at the schedule, Team 10 actually plays in weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (8 games total), not 4 as claimed in the Team Summary.\n\n3. **Duplicate matches in same week**: In Match Day 7, Team 10 appears to play Team 8 twice (listed in two separate rows), violating the \"no team plays more than once in the same week\" rule.\n\n4. **Team 9 scheduling error**: In Match Day 5, Team 9 is scheduled to play both Team 4 and Team 7, violating the same rule.\n\n5. **Data inconsistencies**: The Team Summary shows Team 10 playing \"Team 9, Team 9, Team 9, Team 2\" (only 4 games with Team 9 three times), but the Match List shows Team 10 playing many different opponents across 8 weeks.\n\nThe verification tool incorrectly marks all requirements as passing when multiple critical violations exist in the actual schedule data."

    "explanation": "The provided HTML solution fails to satisfy several key requirements from the original request. Critically, Team 10 is scheduled for at least 9 games across multiple weeks, including playing twice on January 25 (vs. Team 3 and Team 8), violating the \"exactly 4 games\" rule and the strict \"no team plays more than once per week\" constraint. The Team Summary tab incorrectly lists only 4 games for Team 10, mismatched with the actual schedule.\n\nAdditionally, repeat opponents exceed acceptable limits and include back-to-back weeks (e.g., Team 9 vs. Team 10 in weeks 1-3; Team 8 vs. Team 10 in weeks 7-8), contravening the guidelines to avoid repeats where possible and prevent consecutive matchups.\n\nThe Match List tab does not use \"separate columns for each opponent\" as specified; it uses a simple home/away format. Game counts for other teams are inconsistent (e.g., Team 5 lists 9 opponents but claims 8 games). The verification tool falsely marks all checks as passing without performing real validation, misleadingly claiming compliance.\n\nWhile some elements like dates, byes for Team 6, and Team 1/2 constraints are met, these fundamental errors render the solution incorrect.

    "explanation": "The solution violates several key constraints. Most critically, Team 4 is listed with only 7 opponents in the Team Summary (should have 8 games), while Teams 5, 7, 8, and 9 each have 9 opponents listed—indicating 9 games played, exceeding the allowed 8. Team 10 plays Team 9 three times (weeks 1, 2, and 3), which constitutes 2 repeat matches with the same opponent, and all Team 10’s games occur by week 4, violating the requirement that its 4 games can be in “any match week” (not necessarily early). Additionally, Match Day 5 (Dec 21) includes a game \"Team 7 vs Team 9\" but Team 9 already played Team 8 that same day—impossible since a team can’t play twice in one week. Team 5 appears to play Team 7 twice (weeks 2 and 9), and Team 8 plays Team 10 twice (weeks 7 and 8), violating the “no back-to-back repeat opponents” preference. The Byes Per Week table shows Team 6 has byes on Dec 21 and Jan 18 as requested, but Team 10 is shown playing on Dec 21 (Match Day 5), contradicting its total of only 4 games—all supposed to be in weeks 1–4. Finally, the match list includes 9 match days, but weeks 5 (Dec 21), 6 (Jan 11), 7 (Jan 18), 8 (Jan 25), and 9 (Feb 1) skip the excluded dates correctly, yet the game counts per team are inconsistent with stated requirements."

    "explanation": "Team 10 is scheduled far more than four games despite the requirement that it must have exactly four.

Team 5, Team 7, Team 8, and Team 9 likewise exceed the allowed single game per week.\n\nThe schedule also fails the “8 games per team” rule for Teams 3‑9: Team 5 appears nine times, Team 8 nine times, etc., while the Team Summary table incorrectly reports eight games for Teams 3‑9 and only four for Team 10, contradicting the Match List.\n\nAdditionally, the Match List tab does not follow the required structure of “separate columns for each opponent” with seven rows per match day; it uses a single column for each match and varying numbers of rows per day.\n\nBecause these multiple core requirements are unmet, the solution is incorrect."

    "explanation": "The solution has a critical error: Team 10 is required to have exactly 4 games played \"in any match week\" but the solution misinterprets this as having 4 games total. Looking at the Match List:\n\n- Team 10 plays in week 1 (11/23) against Team 9\n- Team 10 plays in week 3 (12/7) against Team 9\n- Team 10 plays in week 4 (12/14) against Team 6\n- Team 10 plays in week 6 (1/11) against Team 5\n\nThis gives Team 10 only ONE game per week for a total of 4 games. The requirement states \"Team 10 must have exactly 4 games played in any match week\" which means Team 10 should play 4 games within a single week/match day. This is impossible given the constraint that \"No team plays more than once in the same week.\"\n\nThe requirement appears to be contradictory - it's impossible for Team 10 to play 4 games in any single match week while also adhering to the rule that no team plays more than once in the same week. The solver attempted to work around this by giving Team 10 exactly 4 games total, but this doesn't satisfy the literal requirement as stated.\n\nAdditionally, there's a minor issue where Team 6 could have been given a bye on both 12/21 and 1/18 while still maintaining 8 games (by playing in all other weeks), but the solution only gives Team 6 a bye on 12/21."
